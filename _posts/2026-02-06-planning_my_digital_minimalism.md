## The current state of things

Screentime and being online for longer than I need to be are issues I've dealth with since getting my first smartphone when I was around 14/15. Growing up I watched probably too much tv and played Monster hunter freedom unit for an upsetting long amount of time, but now that I am older I dont really regret the time I spent on those things. I enjoyed watching spongebob at 6:30 am with my Brother, I enjoyed getting to G-rank on Monster hunter and obsseviely getting every weapon for every weapon tree (if you know you know). But I can confidently say that I have regretted probably 90% of the time I spent on the web. 


Yes I can pull certain video and websites that were fantastic but the vast majority of what I consume on the web I barely remember and don't particularly enjoy doing. None of the youtube video, tweets (are they still called that now?), reddit threads, instagram posts or porn I have consumed has mostly done more damage than good.
